## appx-calc
Short for "approximation calculator". Basic console application written C++.

### what does it do?
Simply, it does left-hand and right-hand approximations of Reimann sums for a function. These allow you to estimate the area under the curve of the function.

Four Current Modes
* Calculates & Averages both Left and Right Approximations To N-Value of Accuracy
* Calculates Error-of-Approximation (EOA) for given bounds with N-Value of Accuracy
* Calculates N-Value for given bounds for a specific EOA requirement
* Calculates N-Value for given bounds for a specific EOA requirement then Calculates & Averages both Left and Right Approximations

:warning: Function To Be Evaluated Must Be Defined In Source Code Within The Functions Currently - Inputting Functions Is TODO (Currently set to f(x)=sin(x) )
